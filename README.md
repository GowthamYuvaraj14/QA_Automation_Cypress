# QA Automation Assessment - Cypress Framework with POM

## Welcome!

This repository contains the automation framework for testing key user flows on the Magento demo website, including:  
- User Signup  
- Login  
- Signout  
- Change Password  

The framework is built using **Cypress** and follows the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern to keep tests clean, maintainable, and scalable.

> **Note:** The target site occasionally returns HTTP 503 Service Unavailable errors during testing. This framework is designed to handle such scenarios gracefully.
